# About Us

## Our Mission

At our core, we are a non-profit association driven by a deep commitment to civic duty, solidarity, and social utility. Our focus is on the holistic well-being and development of individuals in Senegal, particularly children and young people. We are dedicated to supporting their social, cultural, and educational growth, even in the face of challenging socio-economic and environmental circumstances. Additionally, we strive to promote the social and vocational integration of young individuals facing difficulties in finding work. Our ultimate goal is to foster a society founded on principles of inclusivity, dialogue, peace, and solidarity. We actively encourage volunteering and cooperation for development, both locally and internationally.

## Our Initiatives

The Association's primary aim is to sustain the endeavours undertaken by our sister organization, Les Enfants d'Ornella, led by the esteemed Severino Proserpio, a well-known public figure in Como. Together, we work in Yene-Kelle, Senegal, operating from our community centre, "Casa de Solidarite' Giovanni Quadroni." Moreover, we provide support to the "Denise Latini" Nursery School located in the rural village of Daga Dialaw. To accomplish our goals more effectively, we present projects and funding requests to national and international institutions and associations. We actively engage in exhibitions, events, and multimedia initiatives to disseminate knowledge about our work and secure the necessary economic and financial backing. Additionally, we organize the collection of donations and send staff members to actively volunteer at the initiatives we promote or support in Senegal.

# Description of Our Work

## Charity Description

Our Association primarily operates in Senegal, specifically in Yene-Kelle sur Mer, through our "Association d'Education Populaire" named Les Enfants d'Ornella. This organization develops and manages activities with the collaboration of Italian volunteers in Senegal, as well as representatives from local associations and institutions.

## Our Current Activities:

### CASA DE SOLIDARITE' "GIOVANNI QUADRONI":
For over 17 years, our 2000-square-meter facility has served as an educational, supportive, and training centre for children in the surrounding villages of Yene. Within the Giovanni Quadroni community centre, a team of seven dedicated employees provides literacy and school preparation courses for "enfants de la plage" (beach children) who do not have access to formal education. These children, identified by our educators on the beaches, are enrolled in preschool programs at our centre. Simultaneously, we facilitate their registration and ensure they possess all the necessary documents to enrol in school. The centre primarily focuses on assisting Tabliéè children from nearby villages. These children are often abandoned at a tender age by their families and entrusted to self-proclaimed Koranic "teachers." Frequently denied access to formal schooling, they are forced into begging and face various risks. Over time, the Giovanni Quadroni Center has become a trusted haven for these children, offering them food assistance, promoting personal hygiene, providing primary healthcare, and engaging them in literacy, recreational sports, and creative activities. Furthermore, the centre provides open access to all children in the village, providing activities related to music, dance, theatre, and the development of creativity.

### TRAINING CENTER "BRUNELLO BERTONI" AND THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL OF TAILORING:
Adjacent to our centre, the "Brunello Bertoni Vocational Training Centre" was established by our partner association, "Formazione Solidale," to expand the activities of Les Enfants d'Ornella in the field of apprenticeships. This 400-square-meter facility has been instrumental in operating the "Professional School of Tailoring" for young women in the area for the past four years. Through a comprehensive three-year educational program, the school equips girls with technical and professional skills in tailoring. Upon completion of the program, they receive a diploma recognized by the Senegalese Ministry of Vocational Training and Crafts. The school has experienced significant success, attracting over 80 girls to enrol in the training course.

### ADUNA LAB:
Aduna Lab was born in close collaboration with the tailoring school. It is a cooperative that aims to provide employment opportunities for the most talented students from the tailoring program. Currently, the collective employs five girls. This project has led to structural improvements within the B. Bertoni Training Center, preparing it for tailoring production. The centre now possesses professional machinery and tools necessary for marketing the products made. Aduna Lab aspires to serve as a platform for job placement in other sectors, such as tourism and hospitality.

### NURSERY SCHOOL "DENISE LATINI" Village of Daga Dialaw:
Located in the village of Daga Dialaw, the nursery school welcomes children between the ages of 3 and 6. Thanks to the generous bequest of Denise Latini from Certaldo (Firenze), the school is entrusted to a cooperative of local staff who employ three qualified educators. The cooperative focuses on providing a nurturing and pedagogical environment for the children.

### THE ALBINOS OF NIAYES KIAYES:
Niayes Kiayes, situated in the steppe, approximately 8 kilometres from Yene, has received numerous support interventions in recent years. The village is known for the prevalence of individuals with albinism, who often lack the assistance and care necessary to address the challenges posed by their condition. In collaboration with volunteer nurses from Como, we have established a robust network to aid children with albinism. Since 2019, we have been working with the ANAS (National Association of Albinism Senegal) and a nurse from the Yene dispensary to provide sunscreen, medical examinations, and glasses to nine albino schoolchildren.

### VOLUNTEERS AND INITIATIVE TRAVEL WITH US:
We greatly value the active collaboration of numerous young individuals who contribute, even for short periods, to support our initiatives in Senegal. We periodically organise experiential and voluntary trips for our members in partnership with the Association Les Enfants d'Ornella and through our affiliation with the "Begue Pokai" Hostel. These trips provide an opportunity to immerse oneself in the daily life of our small yet impactful association.

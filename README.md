## Charity description
The Association operates mainly in Senegal in Yene – Kelle sur Mer through its "Association d'Education Populaire" called Les Enfants d'Ornella, which develops and manages its activities through a Bureau that provides for the participation not only of some Italian volunteers present in Senegal but also of representatives of the associative realities and local institutional realities.

## The existing activities:

### CASA DE SOLIDARITE' "GIOVANNI QUADRONI":  
In our structure of 2000 square meters for over 17 years, we have been educating, assisting, caring and training children in the villages of the village of Yene.  
Seven employees in the Giovanni Quadroni community centre are responsible for creating literacy and school preparation courses for beach children ("enfants de la plage") who do not attend school. These children, intercepted by our educators on the beaches, are included in preschool courses in our centre. At the same time, we take care of the procedure to be able to register them and make them have all the necessary documents to enrol them in school. 
The centre's work is also mainly aimed at the Talibè children of the nearby villages. In most cases, these children are abandoned at a very young age by their families and entrusted to self-styled Koranic "teachers". They often do not let them attend official school courses and exploit them by forcing them to beg, exposing them to risks of all kinds.
Over time, the Giovanni Quadroni Center has become a point of reference for these children (about 300 throughout the area), offering them food assistance, facilitating body hygiene, providing primary health care, and developing literacy and recreational sports activities.
The Giovanni Quadroni Center is also a space open to all the village's children with its offer of activities dedicated to music, dance, theatre, and the development of creativity.

### TRAINING CENTER "BRUNELLO BERTONI" AND THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL OF TAILORING 
The "Brunello Bertoni Vocational Training Centre" was built next to our centre by our partner Association, "Formazione Solidale", to expand the activities of Les Enfants d'Ornella in the apprenticeship field. It is a structure of about 400 square meters that, for over four years, has housed the "Professional School of Tailoring" aimed toward young women in the area. Through a three-year educational path, the school allows girls to learn technical and professional skills in the sector and, at the end of the third year, obtain a diploma recognized by the Senegalese Ministry of Vocational Training and Crafts. The school immediately enjoyed the considerable success of adhesion involving over 80 girls in the training course. 

### ADUNA LAB
In close collaboration with the tailoring school, Aduna Lab was born, a cooperative that aims to insert the best students of the tailoring school into work. Currently, the collective employs five girls.
The birth of the project has made it possible to carry out structural interventions within the B. Bertoni Training Center preparatory to a tailoring production laboratory, equipping it with professional machinery and tools aimed at marketing the products made. Aduna Lab wants to become a tool for job placement in other sectors, such as tourism and accommodation.

### NURSERY SCHOOL "DENISE LATINI" Village of Daga Dialaw
The nursery school welcomes children aged between 3 and 6 years. It is located in the village of Daga Dialaw and was built thanks to the testamentary legacy of Denise Latini of Certaldo (Firenze). The structure takes care of the didactic and pedagogical approach and is entrusted to a worker cooperative composed of local staff who employ three qualified educators.

### THE ALBINOS OF NIAYES KIAYES
Niayes Kiayes is in the steppe, about 8 kilometres of dusty track from Yene, and has been the subject of numerous support interventions in recent years. The village is known for the constant presence of people suffering from albinism, whose maximum age reaches an average of 20 years — a sign of missing assistance and care that the disease requires. Thanks to a group of volunteer nurses from Como, a strong network was established for helping children suffering from albinism. Since 2019, with the collaboration of ANAS (National Association of Albinism Senegal) and a nurse from the Yene dispensary, a project has been launched to guarantee sunscreen, medical examinations, and the supply of glasses to the nine albino schoolchildren. 

### VOLUNTEERS AND INITIATIVE TRAVEL WITH US
We base on the active collaboration that several young people provide, even for a limited period, in support of the various initiatives in Senegal. In close connection with the Association Le Enfants d'Ornella and hosted at the Hostel "BEGUE POKAI", we periodically organize for members experiential and voluntary trips that allow experiencing the daily life of our small but precious Association.
